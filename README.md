This repo contains artifacts for the semantic versioning study, as follows:

* Vagrantfile/bootstrap.sh/shared: contains a VM description for the artifact; is supposed to install an environment where all tools are available and can run. Currently the bootstrap.sh script downloads all of the benchmarks and runs FB Infer, but I'll probably split that into three scripts: one to provision the VM with tools; one to download the benchmarks; and one to run the analyses.

* shared/projects.json: contains the list of benchmarks to analyze; the scripts above should eventually use this file as the source of truth for where to get the benchmarks, but I haven't implemented that yet.

* shared/output: the driver script should dump csv files for each of the tools in this directory.

* example-jsoup-fbinfer.csv: an example csv file that is to be output by a tool. Includes lines of the form:
"benchmark-version1","benchmark-version2","tool-key","value"

For instance, jsoup 1.10.1 gains two FB Infer warnings, one resource leak and one null deref. I need to understand why these are reported for 1.10.1 and not 1.9.2 (the flagged line is the same, but maybe the callee changed.)
